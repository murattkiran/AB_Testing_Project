#  Business Problem

Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type called "average bidding" as an alternative to the existing "maximum bidding." 

One of our clients, bombabomba.com, decided to test this new feature and wants to understand whether "average bidding" brings more conversions compared to "maximum bidding." 

The A/B test has been running for 1 month, and now bombabomba.com wants you to analyze the results of this A/B test. The ultimate success metric is the "Purchase" variable, so the statistical tests should focus on it.
